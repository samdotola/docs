# What is Concero?

Concero is a **fully decentralised** interoperability protocol built to facilitate secure cross-chain value and message transfers in **under 30 seconds**.
## Why Concero?
Existing cross-chain solutions have to trade security for speed and vice-versa while Concero has been built to be secure and quick at the same time, while being fully decentralised.

Before designing Concero infrastructure, we have spent a lot of time building, iterating and collecting user feedback about different cross-chain aggregation MVPs. This has been done in order to understand the requirements and solve problems that the end users are facing. After thousands of survey results and usage data points we have boiled down user requirements for cross-chain transactions to three main attributes: Speed, Security and Ease of Use. After trying to look for infrastructure that is able to adhere to these attributes, we found that it does not exist, which laid the foundation behind Concero as the infrastructure.

We have also set ourselves a strict set of parameters when building this protocol. It had to be fully decentralised, economically feasible for all participants, and fully transparent. As the entire blockchain industry was built on the core principles of transparency, decentralisation and permissionless access, we believe that it is imperative for protocols to adhere to these principles and Concero does just that.
